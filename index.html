      About Me
    </h2>
    <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-400 pb-2">
      I’m Coach Xavier, and my passion for swimming began in childhood when my
      friends and I would walk long distances just to reach a pool, despite not
      knowing how to swim. But one day, something happened that changed my
      perspective forever. My friends and I, excited for another day of fun,
      decided to venture into the deep end of the pool. None of us had any real
      training, but we felt invincible — kids often do. As I swam farther from
      the shallow side, the water began to feel different. I struggled to stay
      afloat, and for the first time, I panicked. My arms flailed, my breathing
      quickened, and everything around me seemed to blur. I was scared and
      helpless.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-400 pb-2">
      Luckily, a lifeguard noticed me struggling and acted swiftly. In moments,
      I was pulled from the water, shaken but safe. That day, I realized that
      swimming wasn’t just about fun — it was about respect for the water and
      understanding its dangers. My love for swimming remained, but now, safety
      became my top priority.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-400 pb-2">
      Years later, that experience shaped my career when I became a lifeguard
      supervisor at a water park in Dubai. Through my training, I learned how
      essential it is to never underestimate the power of water, no matter how
      confident you feel. I’ve seen firsthand how quickly things can go wrong
      when swimmers don’t respect the safety rules or overestimate their
      abilities.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-400 pb-2">
      Now, as a coach, I teach my students the importance of building skills in
      the water while always keeping safety in mind. Whether you're learning to
      swim for the first time or refining your strokes, understanding the risks
      and preparing for them is just as important as having fun. A confident
      swimmer is one who not only enjoys the water but also knows how to
      navigate it safely.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-400 pb-2">
      Let’s work together to make sure that your swimming journey is as safe as
      it is exciting. Safety isn’t just a lesson — it’s a skill that can save
      lives.
